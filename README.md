# AI-Powered Collections System

This repository presents a responsible and agentic AI-based collections framework designed to reduce delinquency rates and improve customer outcomes in financial services.

## 🎯 Overview

This project was completed in 4 parts:
1. Identifying at-risk customer segments using predictive models
2. Designing targeted interventions for each segment
3. Ensuring fairness, compliance, and explainability in decision-making
4. Finalizing a scalable, AI-powered collections system

## 📊 Final Deliverable

A slide deck that covers:
- How the system works: inputs, decision logic, actions, and learning loop
- Role of agentic AI: autonomous actions vs. human-in-the-loop decisions
- Responsible AI guardrails: fairness, explainability, and compliance
- Expected business impact: both quantitative and qualitative outcomes
